Assignment 3 Readme:
In this program, AVL Trees HAVE been implemented.
 
Note: AVL Trees may only be tested with insertions (i.e. input file a3input1.txt)

In order to compile the program, traverse the command prompt or similar terminal to the directory where this file is located.

Once completed, compile the program by typing in the following to the command prompt:


				   javac BinarySearchTree.java AVLTree.java	

		
Once the program has successfully compiled, type the following in the command prompt to run the program (while still staying in the same directory):


		         java BinarySearchTree inputfile.txt outputfile1.txt outputfile2.txt TypeofTREE

						
Where inputfile is the .txt file that contains the data you wild like to place into a tree and check for,
	
outputfile1 is the user chosen name of the .txt file which prints the nodes of the tree in ascending logical order, and 

outputfile2 is the user chosen name of the .txt file which prints the nodes of the tree level by level (starting at the root node and going down).

TypeofTree is the type of tree to implement and must be either BinarySearchTree of AVLTree.
